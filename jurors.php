		<p>Mary-Elizabeth Nelson is incredibly thrilled to be serving on her first jury ever! She grew up in the small town of Condon, Oregon and after completing two years of college at Portland Community College, she moved to California in hopes of becoming an actress.  She works as an animal caretaker at Furry Friends Animal Shelter, although it really doesn&rsquo;t seem like work to her.</p>
		<p>In her free time, Mary-Elizabeth enjoys playing with her beautiful cats, speaking to her pet parrot, Julian, volunteering at her church, Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's Witnesses, scrap-booking, finger-crocheting, miming, and even taking acting classes at the YWCA! Being named Foreman of the jury for the Donald Pleats case has been one of the highlights of her career, as she is honored to conduct the jury in the name of justice!</p></dd>

		<p>Bernice Monroe is a thirty year old accountant from Boston, Massachusetts. She lives alone with her cat, Lionel in her one bedroom apartment. Her hobbies include cooking, cleaning, and organizing, as well as getting together with her family. She recently campaigned to have Purell bottles in every office in her building, and is happy to report victory. She just hopes she gets that lucky in the deliberation room. She hates public speaking, yelling, and fights. She doesn&rsquo;t like it when people look at her when she&rsquo;s talking, so she asks everyone to look in the other direction when she says something.</p>

		<p>This will be her first time serving as a juror and is glad that her first case will be an easy one. She would like to thank her family for being patient and always supporting everything she undertakes. She also wishes Donald Pleats a warm good luck. </p>

		<p>Franco DeStefano was born under the boardwalks of a Staten Island pier, ready to get his rage on. Don&rsquo;t worry about it, his hair was perfect. He grew up under the shadow of the Verrazano Bridge, in Benson Hurst, Brooklyn. His idols: Johnny Travolta, The Situation, Mother Italia, you know. You can see him double-fisting vodka Redbulls in his Ferrari jumpsuits, dancing to the beat of DJ Pauly D in his favorite club, Karma. Grenades, stay away.</p>
		<p>He recently married his number one dime piece, Gia Marie Braspataliano; they spend their time GTLing, smooshing, you know, all that marriage junk. Franco has some family ties with the mob, but&hellip; actually, don&rsquo;t worry about it&hellip; in fact, forgettaboutit.</p>

		<p>Gia Marie is your normal Jersey girl. She likes her hair big, her men tanned, and her skirts short. Unfortunately she is off the market, she is madly in love with her recent husband Franco.  They found each other at the club, it could have been Karma, but those club nights are all a blur. He was fist pumping and she was dancing on the bar, it was when she began to fall that Franco ran to save her life. They got married a few months later and are now planning to have some mini guidos and guidettes.</p>
		<p>She is one girl you do not want to mess with, her high heels may fool you, but one wrong word and you will wish you were never born. Oh, and NEVER mention anything about her mouth... I am warning you. If you ever want a nice hot meal of spaghetti Franco and herself are the ones to go too, she makes spaghetti better than a nice smoosh.</p>

		<p>Wendell Larson is twenty-six years of age and still lives at home in Grammy&rsquo;s basement. He is a virgin, and will probably retain that title for the rest of his life. In addition to being an expert video game designer, Wendell is a master of WoW and an avid fan of Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy and Glee. He dabbles in the rare  adventure to The White Swallow, a nearby bar, but mostly remains in the depths of his &ldquo;Mancave,&rdquo; a dimly lit cavern wallpapered with Unicorns, Dancing Leprechauns, and Sea Urchins.</p>

		<p>In the criminal justice system, the people are represented by two separate yet equally important groups: the good guys like Christopher Murray (juror number eight) and the jerks that want to prosecute the offenders. The dedicated people like Christopher (who investigate lucrative felonies) tend to think they are members of an elite squad known as the Special Victims Unit. These are their stories.</p>

		<p>I am juror number 9. Juries fascinate me. People fascinate me. And most important&hellip; French fries fascinate me. The taste is very unique. They give me a wonderful feeling of power and satisfaction. I would recommend them, but considering French fries are the only thing on my diet, apart from the liquids, the less you buy, the more for me :).</p>
		<p>Some of you might be shocked to find out that I live at home with lots of company&hellip; my cats. There&rsquo;s Gilber, Frisco, Shinky, Bloik, Scrap, Timber, Shloop, and 6 more which are named the following: One, Two, Three, Four, Five and Six. All my cats are male, and fully &ldquo;equipped&rdquo; if you know what I mean ;) and I get very offended when I find one that is not. It&rsquo;s very RUDE.</p>
		<p>Anyways, I love going to the library every Sunday for reading nights and I also love sitting at home, fantasizing about my French fries, and cats. My dream is to make a film combining the two in some incredible way. My thoughts are still forming on this topic but I&rsquo;m hoping my fellow jurors will star in this movie of mine!</p>
		<p>I&rsquo;m full of great ideas&hellip; I think that is definitely one of my best qualities. So that&rsquo;s me!</p>

		<p>Norm Stroker is celebrating after his recent brush with the law. I took a breath and... .079! Who says you can&rsquo;t party and drive? After dropping out of college after two years, Chip moved to LA to be work for the stars. He is now one of the most exclusive publicist in town. Wanna know some of my clients? Too bad, though he will admit that he was the inspiration for The Hangover. He enjoys partying, public apologies, WoW, and fine community theatre. To be honest, he doesn&rsquo;t know how he was chosen: he was talking to the stars on his Bluetooth&reg; for the entire selection process. And he hates cats.</p>
